# SkillSwap – Decentralized Skill Exchange on Lens Chain

SkillSwap is a Web3-powered decentralized platform that enables individuals to **trade skills directly with one another**, using blockchain smart contracts for trust, transparency, and automation. Powered by **Lens Chain** and the custom **SkillToken**, the platform creates a new way for freelancers, learners, and professionals to collaborate and grow by exchanging what they know best — their skills.

## 🚀 Introduction

In today's world, millions of people have marketable skills but limited access to traditional financial systems or job opportunities. SkillSwap solves this by creating a **peer-to-peer skill exchange platform** where anyone can offer a skill and receive another in return — powered by **blockchain smart contracts** to ensure fairness and transparency.

Instead of hiring or paying in fiat, users can **swap skills** (e.g., "I'll design a logo for you if you help me with coding") or use the platform’s native token, **SkillToken**, to settle transactions. Everything is governed by smart contracts deployed on **Lens Chain**, ensuring trustless operations, immutable records, and automatic verification of transactions.
